    <h1>Artistic Style Subversion Repository</h1>

    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>

    <h3>Artistic Style</h3>

    <p>
        The latest development source is in the Artistic Style repository at SourceForge. It can be checked out using
        Subversion. The source code is under development and some changes take several weeks to complete. The intermediate
        source files have not been through the extensive system tests that are done before each release. Use reasonable
        precautions when using source code from the repository.</p>
    <p>
        The current version is in the "trunk/AStyle" branch of the repository. The file and directory names are case 
        sensitive.</p>
    <p>
        A sample checkout is:<br />
        <strong>svn&nbsp; checkout&nbsp; "https://svn.code.sf.net/p/astyle/code/trunk/AStyle"&nbsp; 
            "$HOME/astyle"</strong></p>
    <p>
        You can also <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/astyle/code/HEAD/tree/">browse the subversion repository</a>.
        The current development release is in the "trunk" directory. This gives you a view into the current status of
        the project's code without actually checking-out the files.</p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>

    <h3>Other Projects</h3>

    <p>
        Two additional Artistic Style projects are available in the repository. They are not maintained for the general
        public, but are available if you want them. You may have to create your own project files and scripts to use 
        them.</p>
    <p>
        All projects, and any additional source required, should be installed in the same top level folder. A sample file
        directory containing ALL the projects should look as follows. The project dependencies are described 
        below.</p>
    <pre>    Projects
        AStyle
        AStyleDev
        AStyleTest
        AStyleWx
        AStyleWxTest
        googlemock
        googletest</pre>

    <h4>AStyleDev</h4>

    <p>
        AStyleDev contains the development files that are made available in the "Developer Information" section. Refer
        to that section for more information.</p>
    <p>
        These projects require the Artistic Style project to compile.</p>
    <p>
        A sample checkout is:<br />
        <strong>svn&nbsp; checkout&nbsp; "https://svn.code.sf.net/p/astyle/code/trunk/AStyleDev"&nbsp; "$HOME/astyledev"
        </strong></p>

    <h4>AStyleTest</h4>

    <p>
        AStyleTest contains the unit test programs and test scripts for Artistic Style. There are over 2500 tests in the
        main test program.</p>
    <p>
        This project requires the Artistic Style project to compile.
        In addition, the test program requires Google Mock and Google Test described below.</p>
    <p>
        The main test project, AStyleTest, can be run in Visual Studio using the graphical Visual Studio Test 
        Explorer. The procedure is described below.</p>
    <p>
        A sample checkout is:<br />
        <strong>svn&nbsp; checkout&nbsp; "https://svn.code.sf.net/p/astyle/code/trunk/AStyleTest"&nbsp; "$HOME/astyletest"
        </strong></p>

    <h4>AStyleWx</h4>

    <p>
        AStyleWx contains a GUI test program for Artistic Style that uses the wxWidgets C++ library.</p>
    <p>
        This project requires the Artistic Style project to compile. 
        Files for download are made available in the 
        <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/astylewx.astyle.p/" target="_blank" title="open new window">Artistic Style
            Wx</a> subproject. The download contains all files needed to compile the project. The subproject can be accessed
        from the Artistic Style SourceForge pages.</p>
    <p>
        A sample checkout is:<br />
        <strong>svn&nbsp; checkout&nbsp; "https://svn.code.sf.net/p/astyle/code/trunk/AStyleWx&quot;&nbsp; "$HOME/astylewx&quot;
        </strong></p>

    <h4>AStyleWxTest</h4>

    <p>
        AStyleTest contains the unit test programs and test scripts for AStyleWx.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>
        This project requires the AStyleWx project to compile. In addition, the test program requires Google Mock and
        Google Test described below.</p>
    <p>
        A sample checkout is:<br />
        <strong>svn&nbsp; checkout&nbsp; "https://svn.code.sf.net/p/astyle/code/trunk/AStyleWxTest"&nbsp; "$HOME/astylewxtest"
        </strong></p>

    <h4>Google Mock and Google Test</h4>

    <p>
        Google Test and Google Mock is the Google multi-platform framework for writing C++ unit tests.
        It is available on <a href="https://github.com/google/googletest" target="_blank" title="open new window">GitHub</a>
        and can be downloaded as a zip file by pressing the green &quot;clone or download&quot; button and selecting 
        &quot;Download ZIP&quot;. The default is to download the master development branch. The latest stable release
        can be obtained by using the dropdown box labeled &quot;Branch: master&quot;, selecting the &quot;tags&quot;
        tab, and then selecting the latest release. The selected release can then be downloaded using the &quot;clone
        or download&quot; button. Download the latest release for googletest and googlemock from the repository.</p>
    <p>
        The Artistic Style project files are set up to use googletest and googlemock installed in the top level folder
        as indicated above. The library compile for googlemock includes googletest. The library compile for googletest
        includes only googletest. The AStyle test programs have their own project files for compiling the test platform.
        There are also compile project files in the downloaded google modules if you want to use them. They create a static
        library file that is linked to the test program. The google downloads contain instructions for using the 
        package. </p>

    <h4>Visual Studio Test Explorer</h4>

    <p>
        Some of the test projects can be run in Visual Studio 2013 or 2015 using Visual Studio Test Explorer.
        If there is a <strong>.</strong>gta<strong>.</strong>runsettings file in the solution directory for a test project,
        the test will run in the Test Explorer.</p>
    <p>
        The &quot;Google Test Adapter&quot; extension must be installed from the &quot;Tools&quot; &gt; &quot;Extensions
        and Updates&quot; menu. After restarting Visual Studio the test window is activated from the &quot;Test&quot;
        &gt; &quot;Windows&quot; &gt; &quot;Test Explorer&quot; menu option. After compiling, the tests will appear in
        the test window. Then they may be run from the &quot;Test Explorer&quot; window or from the &quot;Test&quot; menu
        options.</p>
    <p>
        Test Explorer may be used for other test projects by adding a proper <strong>.</strong>gta<strong>.</strong>runsettings
        file to the solution directory, AStyleTest\build\vs2015 (or vs2013).</p>
    <p>
        The tests can also be run as a command line program by using the standard debug or run button on the menu or
        toolbar.</p>
